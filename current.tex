\subsection{Info Points:}
\label{sec-1-1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Purpose of the round table
\item Coming changes of the module system
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Feedback:}
\label{sec-1-2}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item Feedback of courses per year:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1st-year:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Math software lab is useless, if say mathematica skills are needed, teach them on demand
\item Want 7.5ects for analysis I
\item Mandatory tutorial, in which problems are solved together (perhaps as an option)
\item Also, helps the students checking themselves
\item Analysis II: Currently, homework was too computational
\item Have advanced linear algebra/introductory linear algebra
\item Levels of linear algebra: matrix algebra (applied), foundations of linear algebra (medium), introductory linear algebra (advanced)
\item Second part of linear algebra in second semester (additionally to what is taught now), like at other German universities
\item Undergraduate seminar was very good
\item Perhaps something similar in 6th semester
\end{enumerate}
\item 2nd-year:
\begin{enumerate}
\item More ects for elements of stochastic processes, remove elements of probability from math study program
\item Real analysis is taught too slowly currently
\item Complex analysis is fine
\item Switch algebra and topology (4th vs. 3rd semester)
\item Calculus on manifolds should be in 4th semester as well
\item Numerical methods should be more computational
\item Applied core math module is fine
\end{enumerate}
\item 3rd-year:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Not allowed to take non-major specialization classes
\item Not enough courses in 5th semester
\item Idea: offering classes that can also be taken by masters/physicists, \ldots{}
\item Better advice to students regarding specialization classes
\item Problem: no master. program
\item Want more specialization classes
\item Introductory Topology: second part was too quick and hand-waivy, why are smooth manifolds needed in topology, more about covering spaces
\item Going in direction of algebraic topology
\item Number theory: good, controversial: not really specialization class
\item Calculus on manifolds: good
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item General issues:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Some professors should be more open minded/careful when making comments about students nationalities
\item Grades are published late
\item Not enough classes in math, campus track need to take non math core module
\item Would be cool to be able to take other specialization/master classes instead of 4th core module
\end{enumerate}
\item TAs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item TAs are only given SA contracts and not enough hours, also too little guidance
\end{enumerate}
\item Differential equations: not taught well, too unstructured
\item Under representation of females in math department (faculty)
\item Not enough info about thesis work, expectations for thesis
\begin{enumerate}
\item Deadlines depends on supervisor
\end{enumerate}
\item Triangles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Why are there no math triangles, like number theory. for anyone, math and politics
\end{enumerate}
\item Better options and advertisements (just talk to profs to get spots) for Worldtrack
\item Better info/communication from faculty in general
\begin{enumerate}
\item Module coordinators not accessible
\end{enumerate}
\item Want lecture notes for all lectures
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suggestions: readings for each lecture announced
\item Even better: Lecture notes,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Either by professor
\item Or by a notes-taker (student), being payed and getting credits for it
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
