\section{Discussion of the feedback}
\label{sec-1}
\label{sec:dis}
In this section the feedback will be discussed and suggestions of improvements of the math study program, will be presented. 
We will start with class specific feedback, then discuss general feedback and finally suggested changes of the undergraduate math program structure. 
Finally, the author will give some meta feedback about the round table.

\subsection{Class specific feedback}
\label{sec-1-1}
There was positive feedback for the following classes/modules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Undergraduate seminar
\item Analysis II, but this should receive more credits
\item Complex Analysis
\item The applied core math module
\item Number Theory
\item Calculus on Manifolds
\end{enumerate}

and negative feedback for (except for the classes already mentioned, that should be dropped):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Real Analysis, taught too slowly
\item Introductory Topology, second part was too fast and hand-waivy, additionally too much time was lost teaching background on smooth manifolds
\item Numerical methods, should cover programming to implement the methods, specifically in homework exercises
\item Differential equations, too unstructured
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{General feedback}
\label{sec-1-2}
Furthermore, there were a number of general complaints and suggestions brought up:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There are not enough math classes, campus track students are forced to take a non-math core module
\item It would be nice if students were allowed to take several specialization or graduate classes instead of a fourth core module, when choosing Campus track
\item There is an under-representation of females in the math department (faculty)
\item Some professors should be more careful, when commenting on some students origins
\item Grades are often published late
\item TAs are currently only given SA contracts and SAs/TAs generally receive not enough hours (less then they are spending)
\item Also TAs receive too little guidance
\item Students receive not enough information about thesis work
\item Deadlines and expectations are not communicated well and depend on the supervisor
\item There should be more and better options for World track, the existing options should be better advertised
\item The communication from faculty should be improved in general
\begin{enumerate}
\item In particular, the module coordinators were hardly accessible this semester
\end{enumerate}
\item There should be lecture notes or at least announced pre-readings for math classes
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Suggestions for changing the math study program}
\label{sec-1-3}
The following changes have been suggested:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First year structure
\begin{enumerate}
\item Remove the math software lab
\item give 7.5 ects for Analysis I
\item Add an advanced linear algebra class (like the current introductory linear algebra in third semester)
\item This, advanced linear algebra class could be treated similarly to calculus with its different levels already existing
\item Additionally, add a class linear algebra II in second semester to continue the class advanced linear algebra in first semester
\item Then, the classes foundations of linear algebra (3rd semester) and introductory linear algebra (4th semester) are redundant
\end{enumerate}
\item Second year structure
\begin{enumerate}
\item Remove Elements of probability
\item Give 5 ects for Elements of stochastic processes
\item Move introductory algebra to the third semester and Topology (or Calculus on Manifolds, this alternates) to the fourth
\end{enumerate}
\item Triangle classes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There should be more math triangle classes\\
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Discussion}
Here the main points are removing the math software lab and giving more credits to Analysis I, replacing Foundations of -- and Introductory Linear Algebra, by two 5 ects advanced linear algebra classes throughout the first year and to remove Elements of Probability and instead give 5 ects to Elements of Stochastic Processes, having two class slots per week, instead of just one.  
Also, the order in which students take algebra and Topology/Calculus on Manifolds should be changed.
Overall, these changes amount to one additional class of 5 ects to be taught (the second linear algebra class) and
furthermore move 5 major-related ects from second to the first year, however the overall amount of major-related credits remains the same. 
These changes are needed however, in order to ensure that math students learn prerequisites, before taking classes requiring them and could also be useful to students in other majors. 
Particularly, offering the proposed additional class "advanced linear algebra I" following the same idea that lead to establishing different difficulty/abstraction levels for the calculus classes, can be useful at least also for physics students.
This is also the way linear algebra is taught at most German universities.
Finally, these changes would help better matching the credits received for classes to the actual workload and to better balance the math education across different areas of mathematics. 


\subsection{Meta observations}
\label{sec-1-4}
In this subsection the round table will be discussed as a method of gathering feedback from students.
Overall, the round table was successful. Although only a minority of math students attended the round table, 
there were at least two students in each year as well as further students from other majors (mostly physics), taking the math classes. 
The feedback was very extensive, however still somewhat detailed discussion were possible. 
In particular, compared to the author's experience in the round table last year, 
there were both more and more constructive feedback as well as more student participating in the round table (partially due to the fact that now also first year students were invited).
Also, it proved to be useful to invite not only math students and to invite first year students. 
Therefore, the author wants to suggest these student organized round-tables as a useful addition to currently used ways of gathering feedback.
